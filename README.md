# quiz-app

A multiple choice quiz built with JavaScript as a single-page application. The initial design included various different categories but was ultimately discarded for a single category (the environment) because, as a personal project, I preferred to work on improving one section rather than spending the time copy-pasting.

Initial design:

In the final result, the user has three questions and can choose the answer of each one, from four different choices. The amount of questions the user answers correctly is tallied and, at the end, a score with a small picture, which varies depending on the amount of correct answers, is shown. After answering each question, the screen shows some information about the topic of the question with a related photo.

Final result:
